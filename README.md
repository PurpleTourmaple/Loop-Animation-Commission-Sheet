## Loop Animation Commission Sheet

### ℹ️ As of now, I only make **'loops'**, as in repeating sequences used for GIFs or animations of undefined length.

### ⚠️ Because of an issue with my tools and unexpected crashes, I won't make cum/ejaculation scenes for now.

The *length* of a loop defines the whole repeatable part of the animation. The longer, the more details are done to make sure the loop stays original throughout the *length*.

Note that prices and fees can vary based on the amount of work, alts, and length of the animation. This is done **per-request** and I try to make it the best possible deal. I tend to **gift** some of the features for free based on the total!

## Pricing:

#### Animation Loop:
- Starts at **$100** for a **10s** loop.
- Each **10** seconds multiplies the price by **1.25**. Ex:
	- **20** seconds = **$125**
	- **30** seconds = **$155**
	- **40** seconds = **$190**
	- **50** seconds = **$235**
	- ...
		
#### Alternative Renders:
- Simple alternative render (alt clothes, alt angle, etc): **$35**
- Alternative scene/animation: **starts at $50**, depends on the length (x1.25 each 10 seconds)
- If the total price of the commission is high enough, a discount of **35%** can be offered to additional alts, if more are needed! Meaning even more alts for less!

#### Background:
- Single color, transparent, pattern: **$0**
- 3D Scene: **$5**

#### Features:
- Physics Simulation (breasts, hair, ears, etc): **$10**
- Clothes Simulation (depends on how many outfits/alts): **$10**

- Post Processing: **$5** (free for **> $200 total**)
- Scene FX (dust sim, camera tracking/noise): **$5** (free for **> $200 total**)
- Texture Upscaling and Custom Materials: **$15** (free for **> $200 total**)

#### Details:
- Image Resolution (based on the amount of alts):
	- 1k: **$0**
	- 2k: **$5 per alt/render**
	- 4k: **$10 per alt/render** 
- Model edit: Varying based on the request, usually around **$5 per edit** or **$0 based on the total**
- SFX edit/Video editing with audio: **$10 per alt**, but **lowered based on the total**
