## Loop Animation Commission Sheet

### ℹ️ As of now, I only make **'loops'**, as in repeating sequences used for GIFs or animations of undefined length.

### ⚠️ Because of an issue with my tools and unexpected crashes, I won't make cum/ejaculation scenes for now.

### ⚠️ To avoid loss when working with PayPal and their BS fees, my prices are listed in Euros (€) since this is my local currency. You should mind the conversion rate (1€ = roughly $1.08)
	- For reference, a 100€ commission would be ~ $108

The *length* of a loop defines the whole repeatable part of the animation. The longer, the more details are done to make sure the loop stays original throughout the *length*.

Note that prices and fees can vary based on the amount of work, alts, and length of the animation. This is done **per-request** and I try to make it the best possible deal. I tend to **gift** some of the features for free based on the total!

## Pricing:

#### Animation Loop:
- Starts at **100€** for a **10s** loop.
- Each **10** seconds multiplies the price by **1.25**. Ex:
	- **20** seconds = **125€**
	- **30** seconds = **155€**
	- **40** seconds = **190€**
	- **50** seconds = **235€**
	- ...
	- For anything beyond 2 minutes, I can tweak the price for a better deal, depending on the request!
		
#### Alternative Renders:
- Simple alternative render (alt clothes, alt angle, etc): **35€**
- Alternative scene/animation: **starts at 50€**, depends on the length (x1.25 each 10 seconds)
- If the total price of the commission is high enough, a discount of **35%** can be offered to additional alts, if more are needed! Meaning even more alts for less!

#### Background:
- Single color, transparent, pattern: **0€**
- 3D Scene: **5€**

#### Features:
- Physics Simulation (breasts, hair, ears, etc): **10€**
- Clothes Simulation (depends on how many outfits/alts): **10€**

- Post Processing: **5€** (free for **> 200€ total**)
- Scene FX (dust sim, camera tracking/noise): **5€** (free for **> 200€ total**)
- Texture Upscaling and Custom Materials: **15€** (free for **> 200€ total**)

#### Details:
- Image Resolution (based on the amount of alts):
	- 1k: **0€**
	- 2k: **5€ per alt/render**
	- 4k: **10€ per alt/render** 
- Model edit: Varying based on the request, usually around **5€ per edit** or **0€ based on the total**
- SFX edit/Video editing with audio: **10€ per alt**, but **lowered based on the total**

## Rules and Process:
- You **𝗠𝗨𝗦𝗧** be **𝟭𝟴+** to request a commission.

- After applying for a commission, it will be in a **queue** and you will be contacted as soon as a slot becomes available. A commission **takes time**. I won't do multiple commissions for one request.

- Commissions must be paid in advance via **PayPal** and I have the right to decline a request before payment. A **link** for the payment will be given to you with the confirmation. (Changes to the commission can be made up to this point, before payment)

- When a commission have been started, **refunds** will depend on the **amount of work** that have been put into your request.
	- Full refund before work starts
	- 50% if work is halfway done
	- No refund if final render is complete

- Once done, the commission will be **sent via email** to ensure the image quality is kept intact. (Unless told otherwise). An exception is made for large numbers of renders, those will be on my personal **Goggle Drive**, but if they get deleted, just let met know and I'll send them again.

##### I am very open to requests including *fetishes*, as long as you are respectful about it.
